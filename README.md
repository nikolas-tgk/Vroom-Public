Description  
Vroom matches passengers for inter-city travel using private vehicles in Greece. It allows users to register the trips they are planning, as well as to locate other users interested in the same route and date. At the same time, users can browse and participate in registered trips. It allows users to save money by sharing travel expenses while making new social connections. To help with organization, the app integrates live chat using push notifications. In addition, a user rating system has been implemented, aiming to improve the overall user experience and enhance safety on the platform.
